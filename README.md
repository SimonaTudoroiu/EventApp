# Description
“EventApp” is a mobile application for event management. This application aims to
improve the event promotion process, providing significant support to venue administrators,
and having the chance to highlight their venue in a designated place.

The venue administrators can promote events that are taking place in their venues by
posting them on the application, editing them and sending notifications to all users
participating in the event. At the same time, they can see the number of people who reserved
seats for a certain event and the reviews received after the event. They can facilitate the
process of planning events through the calendar present in the application, where all the
events that will take place can be entered and managed.

Users of this application benefit from a space dedicated to finding events. They can
view all the events present in the application, reserve seats, give reviews, manage their time
through the present calendar, unique to each user, and view the events they have reserved.

A bonus of the application is the interactive map that users will enjoy, with the aim of
locating the events on the map, so the user has an overview of all the events and where they
are located, with the possibility of seeing an approximate route to the location.
